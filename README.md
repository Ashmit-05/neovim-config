# neovim-config
my personal neovim setup

As of now, this neovim setup is configured only for Golang.
It works very well for autocompletion
Autoformatting has been commented out due to some issues
**Debugging support hasn't been added yet**

When distro-hopping, just clone this. Install nvim(version should be higher than 0.9)
and run the command :
`git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1`
After that, just run nvim and let it install.
